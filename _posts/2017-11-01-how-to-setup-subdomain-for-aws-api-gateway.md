I needed to setup a subdomain for a REST service hosted in AWS API Gateway.  

Many components had to configured correctly to get all pieces to work together. I could not find a concise instructions online and there is too much of stuff to read in AWS documentation. I will share the exact steps I did to get it working so that others doesn't have to figure it out in a hard way like I did.

## Goal
I will be using `mydomain.com` as an example domain in this post.

I already own a mydomain.com purchased with namecheap.com. Also the root domain - mydomain.com is already served by Wix.com and it was setup by [configuring name servers](https://support.wix.com/en/article/tutorial-connecting-your-domain-using-name-servers).  My goal was to create subdomain ***api.mydomain.com*** to point to AWS API Gateway and still have *mydomain.com* to work with Wix.

Here are the step by step instructions on how I got it working:

## 1. Obtained HTTPs certificates from ACM
The first step is I need to request certificates for my site in Amazon Certificate Manager (ACM).  Here are the steps:

1. Logged in to Amazon Certificate Manager (ACM) and switched region to N. Virginia (This is **important**) 
2. Clicked on Request Certificate
3. Entered  `*.mydomain.com`  for domain name.
4. Clicked “Add another name to this certificate” and entered `mydomain.com` .
5. Clicked on Review and Request.
6. I received an email with link to Approve the request.

After approval, certificate looked like this

## 2. Created Custom domain in API Gateway

The next step is to add custom domain to API Gateway:

1. Logged in to Amazon API Gateway
2. Clicked on *“Custom Domain Names”* on the left nav bar
3. Entered `api.mydomain.com` for domain name.
4. Selected certificate created in previous step for ACM Certificate.
5. Added base path mapping that for path `/` to destination as my deployed API Gateway application.
6. Clicked *“Save”*
7. Note down the  cloud front distribution url shown at “Target Domain Name” .

Here is snapshot of my API Gateway configuration

## 3. Created Hosted Zone in AWS Route 53.

Next I defined DNS settings AWS Route 53:

1. Logged in to AWS Route 53.
2. Clicked on *“Create Hosted Zone”*
3. Provided domain name as `mydomain.com` and clicked create. (**Note domain should be root domain and not subdomain**)
4. Selected the created domain to configure `A` Record.
5. Clicked on “Create Record Set”
6. Entered `api.mydomain.com` as Name
7. Chose *“A- IPv4 Address”* for type.
8. Selected *"Yes"* for Alias.
9. Entered cloud front distributed id created in previous step as value.

My Hosted zone alias looked like ethis

## 4. Added Route 53 Name servers in Namecheap
I had wix nameservers under DNS settings of my domain in Namecheap. I removed Wix name servers and added AWS Route 53 Name servers. I found name servers on Hosted Zone of my domain in Route 53 *“NS”* type record set like below snapshot

## 5. Switch Wix domain setup to pointing configuration
I need to change wix domain connection type to *"pointing"* from dns servers. So I disconnected my domain from wix and went through domain setup wizard. I chose connection type to *"pointing"* and I followed these instructions provided by Wix.

> For yourdomain.com, 
>
> 1. create an A record that points to: 23.236.62.147 
> 2. www.yourdomain.com, create a Cname record that points to: www174.wixdns.net 
> 3. m.yourdomain.com, create a Cname record that points to: www174.wixdns.net 

So logged into Route 53 again to setup these A and CNAME record sets.

## Tips and Tricks
Here are the list problems I encountered and tips to solve it.

### Can’t use both Wix and Route 53 nameservers.

I first tried to keep Wix name servers along with Route 53 name servers. But the domain api.mydomain.com become unresolvable. Then instead of using Route 53, I tried directly adding CNAME in wix to point `api.mydomain.com` to cloudfront target domain configured for my custom domain. But I got it returned this error:

> ERROR
> The request could not be satisfied.
> Bad request. Generated by cloudfront (CloudFront)

So I had to remove wix name servers and switch Wix custom domain setup to pointing type configuration.

### Custom domain name in API Gateway should be subdomain.

When I used root domain name in API Gateway custom domain configuration I got this SSL error:

> unsupported protocol.
> ERR_SSL_VERSION_OR_CIPHER_MISMATCH

The error is misleading, but the real reason is the auto created cloud distribution had  wrong value for alternate domain name since I used root domain name instead of subdomain name.

### Base path mapping is required custom domain setup.

First I missed to add base path mapping in custom domain setup and I got `Bad request. Generated by cloudfront (CloudFront)`  error. This is because without base path mapping cloud front won’t know what destination to route the request. After adding the base path, It worked like a charm!
